\chapter{Degenerate PT}
\label{chapt2} 

\section{Introduction}

In the previous section we applied a perturbation to a known system and found the first and second order corrections to energy eigenvalues and the first order correction to eigenstates. However we assumed that there was no degeneracy involved. By considering Eq~\ref{FirstOrderEigenstateCorrection} and Eq~\ref{FirstOrderEnergyCorrection} we can see that if there are degenerate energy levels, i.e distinct eigenstates with the same eigenvalue $E^0_p = E^0_n$, then we have a problem.
