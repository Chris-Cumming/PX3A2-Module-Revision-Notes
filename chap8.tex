\section{Introduction}

This chapter aims to explain the basic operating principles of how a laser actually works. This is done using the Einstein coefficients and briefly motivates the use of time dependent PT which was described in the previous chapter. It finishes by exploring how a He-Ne laser using metastable stats operates.

\section{Derivation}

A laser produces coherent, highly directional and near monochromatic light by using Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER). This process involves exciting electrons to higher energy levels of an atom and then using an external source of photons to cause stimulated emission in order to produce more photons.

\subsection{Einstein Coefficients}

An easy way to model how a laser fundamentally works is by using Einstein coefficients. This is done by considering an atom contained within a cavity and possesses two energy levels, $E_j$ and $E_i$, which are separated by $h\nu$ and where $E_j$ is the ground state energy level. It is then assumed that there are three processes that an electron within this system can undergo in the presence of light and that each of these processes had some constant associated with them which contains the dynamics and likelihood of the process. We assume that these processes are stimulated absorption, stimulated emission and spontaneous emission, with Einstein coefficients $B_{ji}$, $B_{ij}$ and $A_{ij}$ respectively. 

\noindent We further assume that the photons are quantised with energy $h\nu$ and that the spectral energy density of photons within the cavity is given by:

\begin{equation}
    U(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3(e^{\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} - 1)},
    \label{PlanckSpectralEnergyDensity}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\nu$ is the frequency of the photons and $T$ is the temperature of the cavity.

\noindent So if we consider an ensemble of identical atoms in thermal equilibrium within the cavity, then the rate of atoms which have electrons moving to the excited state is given by:

\begin{equation}
    R_{j \rightarrow i} = N_j B_{ji} U(\nu, T),
    \label{StimulatedAbsorptionAtoms}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N_j$ is the number of atoms with an electron in the ground state. This is because there is only one process that can take the electron from the ground state, $E_j$, to the excited state, $E_i$, which is stimulated absorption. However, the rate of atoms with electrons moving from the excited state to the ground state is given by:

\begin{equation}
    R_{i \rightarrow j} = N_i[A_{ij} + B_{ij} U(\nu, T)],
    \label{StimulatedSpontaneousEmissionAtoms}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N_i$ is the number of atoms with the electron in $E_i$. Contained in this are the other two processes: stimulated emission and spontaneous emission, which cause electrons to move to the ground state. If we assume that the rate of atoms with electrons moving between $E_j$ and $E_i$ are equal, i.e $R_{j \rightarrow i} = R_{i \rightarrow j}$, we find that:

\begin{equation}
    U(\nu, T) = \frac{A_{ij}}{B_{ji} e^{\frac{h \nu}{k_B T}} - B_{ij}},
    \label{SpectralEnergyDensityLaser}
\end{equation}

\noindent where we have assumed that, since the atoms are in thermal equilibrium, the population of atoms with an electron in the excited state follows the Boltzmann distribution:

\begin{equation}
    N_i = N_j e^{\frac{-h \nu}{k_B T}}.
    \label{BoltzmannDistributionPopulationStates}
\end{equation}

\noindent If we compare Eq~\ref{SpectralEnergyDensityLaser} to Eq~\ref{PlanckSpectralEnergyDensity}, we find that when in thermal equilibrium:

\begin{eqnarray}
    B_{ij} = B_{ji} \label{InitialEinsteinCondition}\\
    \frac{A_{ij}}{B_{ji}} = \frac{8 \pi h \nu^3}{c^2}.\label{FinalEinsteinCondition}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent As a result, if we can experimentally determine one of the coefficients then we can determine the other two coefficients as well.

\noindent Instead of the rate of change of atoms with electrons in some particular energy level, we can consider the rate of change of the number of photons within some cavity simply by modifying Eq~\ref{StimulatedAbsorptionAtoms} and Eq~\ref{StimulatedSpontaneousEmissionAtoms} to include the number of photons with a particular frequency, $N(\nu$), instead of $U(\nu, T)$, such that:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN^+}{dt} = N_i A_{ij} + N_i B_{ij} N(\nu),
    \label{StimulatedSpontaneousEmissionPhotons}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the rate of increase of photons within the cavity and:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN^-}{dt} = N_j B_{ji} N(\nu),
    \label{StimulatedAbsorptionPhotons}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the rate of decrease of photons within the cavity. There will also be a loss of photons due to leakage from the cavity. So the overall rate of change of photons within the cavity is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{dN^+}{dt} - \frac{dN^-}{dt} = N_i A_{ij} + N_i B_{ij} N(\nu) - N_j B_{ji} N(\nu) - \frac{N(\nu)}{\tau_0},
    \label{OverallRateChangePhotons}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the final term accounts for the leakage of photons using some characteristic timescale, $\tau_0$. If we assume that $B_{ji} = B_{ij}$, as suggested by Eq~\ref{InitialEinsteinCondition}, then we can rearrange the above expression into the following form:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN}{dt} = N_i A_{ij} + N(\nu)[(N_i - N_j)B_{ij} - \frac{1}{\tau_0}].
    \label{OverallRateChangePhotonsRearranged}
\end{equation}

\noindent This shows that unless $N_i > N_j$ then $\frac{dN}{dt} < 0$, meaning the number of photons present in the cavity will decrease with time. However according to Eq~\ref{BoltzmannDistributionPopulationStates} this won't be the case at thermal equilibrium. This means that through some non-thermal method we need to create a population inversion where there are more atoms with their electrons occupying the excited state than there are occupying the ground state. There are a number of ways of creating this population inversion. One of the more common methods is to use metastable states. These are electronic states with long lifetimes when occupied. A typical lasing medium that involves metastable states is a combination of Helium and Neon. First, one of the ground state He atoms is excited into an excited metastable state using an electrical discharge. This He atom will then collide with a Ne atom causing the energy the excited electron in the He atom gained to be transferred to the Ne atom, meaning one of its electrons moves into an excited state. At this point the external photon causes stimulated emission of the Ne atom, causing the excited electron to move to a lower energy excited state, where the energy difference in energy levels corresponds to the energy of the initial incoming photon. This means two photons of the same frequency are produced. The electron will then de-excite further to the ground state. For a He-Ne laser the wavelength of light outputted is 632.8~nm. Other combinations of different elements which contain metastable states can be chosen in order to change the wavelength of light that the laser produces.

\subsection{Time Dependent PT}

We can use time dependent PT in order to determine the forms of the Einstein coefficients.
